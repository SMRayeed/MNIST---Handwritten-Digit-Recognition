# MNIST---Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. This project is about classifying & recognizing the handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Here, 'categorical_crossentropy' is used as a loss function since there are 10 categories/labels; as optimizer, 'adam' has been used, and two Convolutional layers have been used as the basic building block of the model. After training the model with the training dataset, the accuracy for testing dataset was 99.24%.
